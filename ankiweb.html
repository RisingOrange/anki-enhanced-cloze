This add-on adds a more powerful cloze deletion note type.

A more detailed explanation is given on the page of the original version for <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/873439973">the old anki version 2.0</a>.

<b># general warnings</b>
- You should probably not use this add-on at the moment. This add-on has no maintainer. In 2020-02   it seems to work witht the current version of Anki. But who knows if this will hold true for future versions of Anki. If something breaks there's a good chance that no one will help you so. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- For each cloze you add this add-on copies the whole text. So if you paste 1000 words into the first field of an enhanced cloze note and do 20 clozes the note will have ultimately 21000 words. If you do this often the size of your database will increase substantially. You can only use Ankiweb if your database (excluding any images which are not in the database) is smaller than 100mb.
