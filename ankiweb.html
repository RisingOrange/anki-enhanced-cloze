Cloze notes are very powerful for spaced repetition softwares like Anki. This add-on along with the attached note type
aims to improve Anki's mechanism of displaying clozes and offer some great features for better user interaction.

The name of the note type the add-on uses is "<b>Enhanced Cloze 2.1 v2</b>".

<b>Main features</b>
<li>Improved Mechanism of Displaying Clozes</li>
<ul>
    <li>Take card1 for example.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All c1 clozes (let me call them "genuine cloze" for this card) will be red.</li>
        <li>All other clozes (let me call them "pseudo cloze" for this card), eg. c2, c3 will be blue.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>On the front of the card, all clozes (genuine or pseudo) will be shown as their hint (if one exists) or empty.
    </li>
    <li>You can show the answer of every cloze (genuine or pseudo) by clicking it.</li>
    <li>This means you can think about a genuize cloze and check the answer one by one without getting hints from
        pseudo-clozes and genuine clozes after it.</li>
</ul>

<li>Handy Keyboard And Touchscreen Shortcut</li>
<ul>
    You can ...
    <li>uncover genuine clozes one by one using the keyboard shortcut [J] (conifgurable) or by touching the left
        border of the card</li>
    <li>uncover pseudo clozes one by one using the keyboard shortcut [N] (conifgurable) or by touching the right
        border of the card</li>
    <li>toggle all genuine clozes using the keyboard shortcut [Shift+J] (conifgurable)
        border</li>
    <li>toggle all pseudo clozes using the keyboard shortcut [Shift+N] (conifgurable)
        border</li>
    <li>This makes uncovering clozes super convenient, no matter whether it's on a computer using the keyboard or on a
        mobile phone.</li>
    <li>You can edit the shortcut keys by editing the configuration section of the note type (top of the front card
        template).</li>
</ul>

<li>Auto Scroll To The Relevant Cloze</li>
<ul>
    <li>The card will scroll to the first genuine cloze at the very beginning.</li>
    <li>When you use shortcut to uncover clozes one by one, if the next cloze is out of view (common situation on
        mobile phones with small screen), the card will automatically scroll to it. Super fluent experience of
        answering cards. This behaviour can be turned off (by editing the configuration section of the note type)</li>
</ul>

<li>Can Be Used In No-Cloze Basic Mode</li>
<ul>
    <li>It is also Ok to go without clozes using this cloze-type templates. Just type question in Content field and
        answer in Note field. Note, as answer, will be hidden on the front-card and shown on the back-card, just the way
        Basic template does.</li>
    <li>Anki won't warn you that no cloze are found.</li>
</ul>

<li>"Normal" clozes</li>>
<ul>
    <li>If you want a cloze to alway be displayed when it's a pseudo cloze, prepend the answer with a #-sign like this:
        {{c1::#some text}}.</li>
</ul>

<b>Usage</b>
<ul>
    <li>In the editor select the "Enhanced Cloze 2.1 v2" note type</li>
    <li>The content field is the only necessary field that you have to write something into. Other fields are optional.
    </li>
    <li>Write down anything in the Content field, whether with clozes like {{c1::abc}} or not, the add-on will process
        the note intelligently.</li>
    <li>For you information, you may create clozes with increasing numbers like {{c1::aa}} {{c2::bb}} with Ctrl+Shift+C
        and clozes with the same number like {{c1::aa}} {{c1::bb}}.</li>
    <li>I'd recommend you to group several closely related pieces of information to use the same cloze number and review
        them together on a card for convenience; use different cloze numbers to turn you informative note into several
        cards to maximize review efficiency.</li>
</ul>
