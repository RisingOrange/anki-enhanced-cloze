one_content = """<div>Enhanced Cloze Introduction:</div><div><ul style="margin-left: 20px; "><li>Main Feature</li><ul><li><u>Imporved mechanism of dealing with cloze notes</u></li><ul><li>This cloze-type template is fully compatible with Anki's built-in "One cloze note to several cloze cards" mechanism by using markups like { {c1::cloze1} } { {c2::cloze2::hint} } etc. (I add an extra space here in order to display the cloze section as plain text. Don't worry. )</li><li>However, this template along with the hero behind the scene, the python add-on, greatly improved display mechanism of clozes in such a way:</li><li>&nbsp;{{c1::Clozes can be clicked to display the answer one by one ( actually, can toggle between answer and hint , try clicking here again) ::Try clicking here!}}. {{c1::Another Cloze::Then here!}}. So, you can quiz yourself on clozes one by one without having to think about several clozes and then uncover all clozes simultaneously.</li><li>{{c2::I'm c2::Click here.}} This card serves as card for cloze1 i.e. { {c1::abc} }, and other clozes i.e. { {c2::abc} } { {c3::abc} } are shown in blue. Generally you don't have to care about them, but they can also be shown by clicking if necessary, eg. if you want to get a hint from them. &nbsp;</li></ul><li><u>Handy Keyboard and Touchscreen! Shortcut</u></li><ul><li>Before moving on, please install this add-on&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1280253613">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1280253613</a>&nbsp;and restart Anki. That add-on is necessary for me to workly properly.</li><li>Now if you are using a keyboard, try pressing key [ i ], and one more time! Yes, you can show cloze one by one using keyboard short [ i ] ! Now press [ i ] a third time, do you see a red region flickering on the left? It's telling you that there are no more clozes!</li><li>What about touchscreen devices without hardware keyboard, you can click on both the left and right border of the card to do the same thing! Super convenient, isn't it? Please note that there is a inner counter to record which clozes have been shown BY THE PROGRAM, you click-to-show action isn't taken into consideration.</li><li>Generally you don't have to care about irrelevant clozes on current card, eg. { {c3::abc} } on card1, but you can click each of them to show it and press key [ , ] or touch the top border of the card to show them all!</li><li>One more thing, Info, Note, Source, Extra parts down below will be shown on the back side. If you need to see their content on the front side, just click the colorful header. Your card is at your disposal. : )</li></ul><li><u>Auto Scrolling to Cloze</u></li><ul><li>If you have a card with, eg. c1, c2, c3 and c4 clozes, and this card is card4 for c4 cloze,&nbsp;it will auto scroll to the first c4 cloze. And when you use shortcut [ i ] or touch the border to show next cloze, if it is out of view (the card is too long, espcially on mobile phones), the card will scroll to show it! Amazingly smart card, isn't it?</li></ul><li><u>Can Be Used In Q&amp;A Mode Without Any Cloze</u></li><ul><li>Anki will warn you if there are no cloze on cloze-type note. I use some magic tricks to cheat Anki. So you can just put question in Content section and answer in Note section. That's too say, it's a combination of Cloze and Basic note type.</li></ul><li><u>Colorful element</u></li><ul><li>Your eyes and brain enjoy colors. I use color scheme from Google Logo for elements on the card, hope you enjoy it!</li></ul><li><u>Even more minor features for you to explore!</u></li></ul><li>Customization</li><ul><li>Change keyboard shortcut. Search for "SETUP KEY BINDING" in Front-template and change [ i ] and [ , ] to any key to meet your need.</li><li>Change fields.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Don't change the Note-type name, ie "Enhanced Cloze"</li><li>Don't delete or change these fields' names: "# Content", "Note", "In-use Clozes", "Clozes99", "Cloze1" ~ "Cloze20" unless you know how to modify the python code correspondingly.</li></ul></ul><li>Usage</li><ul><li>Cards will get updated every time modify the note. You don't have to worry about it. There is one exception. That is when you edit notes in the card browser, cards won't get updated until you close the browser window. You may force the process of updating cards in the Menu -&gt; Update Enhanced Clozes</li><li>You may want to turn off "Bury related new cards until next day" in this deck's option because clozes on related cards aren't shown automatically and won't give you hints that you don't want to see.</li></ul><li><b><u>Donation</u></b></li><ul><li>I just wrote this add-on for myself at very first, and decide to publish it out to share with you. It took me much time to improve the design, write and clean up the code, and write this introduction for you.</li><li>If you like my add-on, please consider buying me a cup of coffee or a meal. Thank you in advanced for your kindness.&nbsp;</li><li>Here are ways to donate.
